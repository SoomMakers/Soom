Soom is a Web App project to let people could substantially and efficiently reduce waste generation by having a resource-saving lifestyle.

According to Charles Duhigg, an author of 'The Power of Habit,' people need three steps to establish a lifestyle pattern: cue(trigger), routine, and rewards. To set the resource-saving lifestyle for our application users, we implemented these steps. 

Additionally, the application 'Soom' has a community page that allows people to share their experiences and accomplishments with others.
